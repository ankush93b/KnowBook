    <h1>Saifullah Khalid</h1><hr>
    <p>Saifullah Khalid is a key terrorist associated with <a href="Lashkar-e-Taiba.html">Lashkar-e-Taiba</a> (LeT). He was a top mind behind orchestrating several high-profile terror attacks in India. Over a span of five years between 2001 and 2006, Saifullah Khalid orchestrated three major attacks in India. These include - The CRPF camp assault in Rampur in 2001, The Indian Science Congress (ISC) attack in Bengaluru in 2005 and the 2006 attack on the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) headquarters in Nagpur.</p>
    <p>The attacks claimed numerous Indian lives and saw a skyrocketing escalation in LeT's operation on the country's soil.</p>
    <p>Using the alias “Vinode Kumar”, Khalid spent several years living in Nepal. There, he lived under a flase identity and married a woman named Nagma Banu. Khalid is believed to have coordinated activities for the terror outfit LeT from Nepal. He maintained a low profile and apparently played a key role in logistics as well as recruitment of members.</p>
