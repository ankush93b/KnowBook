    <h3>May 2025</h3>
    <p>Tech giant Microsoft has confirmed the layoff of approximately three per cent of its workforce across various teams and geographies. In the wake of the announcement, affected employees and their families have taken to social media to express their distress. An employee who had been with the company for 25 years, was laid off after being â€œrandomly selected by a computer algorithm. His last day at Microsoft was his 48th birthday.</p>
