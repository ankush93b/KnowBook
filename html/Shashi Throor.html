    <h1>Shashi Tharoor</h1><hr>
    <p></p>
    <h3>Ongoing Life</h3>
    <h4>May 17, 2025</h4>
    <p>He has been given a lead role in a government delegation for a mega diplomatic outreach programme to key partner countries over the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack and India's subsequent retaliation againt terror camps located in Pakistan, named Operation Sindoor. He termed the opportunity as a “great honour” and a “matter of duty” as a citizen of India and said he looks forward to play his part in leading the delegation even as his party, Congress, has frowned upon his inclusion. He asserted that only national interest is above everything else.</p>
        <P>“I have always said that when my services are required for the nation, I should not be found wanting and I had no hesitation in accepting the kind invitation of the government, which to my mind is nothing to do with politics and everything to do with our country's national interest. National interest, in my mind, are always above everything else.”</P>
        <p>Congress had nominated Anand Sharma, Gaurav Gogoi, Syed Naseer Hussain and Amrinder Singh Raja Warring to join the government delegation but the Centre, ignoring the list, included Shashi Tharoor to lead a delegation. Shashi Tharoor will lead a delegation to the United States.</p>
        <p>Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said that Salman Khurshid was also approached by the government and he told them that the party has to decide.You cannot include names of MPs (in delegations) without consulting the party. In a democratic system, when individual MPs are sent on an official delegation, MPs should seek the concurrence of the party.</p>
        <p>Congress accused the government of playing "Narad Muni politics." and added that asking for names and then naming someone different was ‘dishonest’ of the government's part</p>
        <p>BJP questioned the Congress' decision to not nominate Shashi Tharoor's name despite his knowledge on the matters of foreign policy and said no one can deny Shashi Tharoor’s eloquence, his long experience as a United Nations official, and his deep insights on matters of foreign policy and wondered whether the decision was made out of ‘insecurity’ or jealousy. </p>
