    <h3>Brand Ambassador</h3>
    <p>In May 2025, the Congress-led Karnataka government has signed a two-year contract with Bollywood actress Tamannaah Bhatia for a reported sum of Rs 6.2 crore.</p>
    <h4>Criticism</h4>
    <p>The move has drawn sharp criticism from pro-Kannada groups, local activists, and opposition leaders that the choice of a non-Kannada-speaking actor to represent one of Karnatakaâ€™s most treasured heritage brands and that the government should have chosen a Kannada actress to represent a brand that is deeply rooted in Karnataka's cultural legacy. Responding to the criticism, government said that the Mysore Sandal already has strong brand recall within Karnataka. The objective was to expand the reach of Mysore Sandal Soap beyond Karnataka and position it as a national and global brand.</p>
