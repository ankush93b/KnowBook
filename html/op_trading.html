    <h1>Opinion Trading</h1><hr>
    <p>Opinion (or event) trading allow users to place bids on the outcome of an event, such as the outcome of a cricket match, the value of assets such as Bitcoin. Prediction markets consider the answer to the question as a ‘contract’, much like a futures or an options contract. Kalshi is an opinion trading platform that is regulated by the US’s Commodity Futures Trading Commission and is legal for all US residents. However, other global firms such as Polymarket are illegal in the country. An older venture named iPredict ran in New Zealand between 2008 and 2016, but shut down following legal challenges.</p>
    <h3>Opinion trading in India</h3>
    <p>Opinion trading is neither legal nor illegal. But trading apps are making a case to recognise it as skill-based gaming, and not betting. Recently, two papers made this argument; the first was written by a professor from IIT Delhi and commissioned by trading firm Probo, and another by law firm Evam Law and Policy. They used mathematical evidence to show that successfully taking positions on the outcome of events—such as a cricket match—is determined by a user’s skills and knowledge, and not by chance. If they can prove it, they could be recognised as real-money skill-based games, much like fantasy cricket or online poker.</p>
