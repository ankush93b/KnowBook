    <p>
    Celebi is a Turkey based company which provides airport ground handling

  <h3>Ingoing Events:</h3>
  <h4>May 17, 2025</h4>
  <p>
    Celebi has launched a legal challenge in Delhi High Court to Indian govt's
    decision to overturn its security clearance, arguing that "vague" national
    security concerns were cited without reasoning and arguing it would impact
    3,791 jobs and investor confidence, and was issued without any warning to
    the company. The Indian government revoked Celebi's security clearance in
    the "interest of national security."
  </p>
  <p>
    "Mere rhetoric of national security without elaborating upon in what manner
    is an entity a threat to national security is unsustainable in law," the
    company said in the filing. The order "fails to disclose any specific or
    substantive reason except for a vague and general reference to 'national
    security' provides no reasons or justification."
  </p>
  <p>
    In its filing, Celebi said that while its shareholders were registered in
    Turkey, "majority end control" of the group is held by companies that do
    not have Turkish incorporation or origin.
