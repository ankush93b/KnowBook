    <h1>Mohini Mohan Dutta</h1><hr>
    <p>Mohini Mohan Dutta is a former director at the Taj Hotels Group and a close associate of Ratan Tata.</p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Dutta shared a bond with Tata that spanned more than sixty years. Their initial encounter occurred at the Dealers Hostel in Jamshedpur when Dutta was 13 and Tata was 25. He later moved to Mumbai and took up residence at Tata’s Bakhtawar home in Colaba. Dutta has publicly credited Tata for shaping his personal and professional life.</p>
    <h3>Professional Life</h3>
    <p>He began his professional journey at the travel desk of the Taj group. In 1986, with financial support from Tata Industries, he launched Stallion Travel Services. Tata Group companies were subsequently directed to utilise Stallion’s services for their travel needs.</p>
    <p>In 2006, Stallion was integrated into a Taj Hotels subsidiary, leading to Dutta’s appointment as director of the resulting firm, Inditravel. He ranked among the highest-paid executives at Taj during his tenure. The travel services division was later transferred to Tata Capital in 2015, which eventually sold it to Thomas Cook India in 2017. Dutta continued to hold a board seat until 2019, when the business was consolidated under Thomas Cook.</p>
    <p>He was also a director of TC Travel Services, an erstwhile affiliate of Thomas Cook.</p>
    <h3>Aftermath Ratan Tata's Demise</h3>
    <p>Mohini Mohan Dutta initially expressed reservations regarding the distribution of Ratan Tata’s estate.</p>
    <p>He was unable to legally contest the will due to a “no-contest” clause and agreed to the conditions outlined in the late industrialist’s will, which allocates him one-third of Tata’s residual estate, estimated to be worth approximately Rs 588 crore along with over one lakh shares of Tata Capital. The rest of the residual estate—excluding real estate and shareholdings—will be equally divided between Tata’s two half-sisters, Shireen Jejeebhoy and Deanna Jejeebhoy.</p>
    <p>Among the recipients named in the will, Dutta is the only individual outside the Tata lineage to be awarded a share of such magnitude.</p>
